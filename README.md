## Performance Video
To demonstrate the functionality and the capabilities of our self-driving car prototype, we have recorded a performance video showcasing its navigation, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous decision-making in a simulated environment. The video highlights key features such as wall tracking, sensor-based movement, and system stability under various conditions. This visual documentation provides evidence of our vehicle's real-time performance and serves as a practical validation of our design and programming approach.

# 1.0 Mobility Management
The mobility management section should provide a comprehensive analysis of the vehicle’s locomotion system, detailing how movement is achieved and regulated. This includes the specification and justification of motor types selected, along with the integration process and control mechanisms implemented. A technical overview of the vehicle chassis also had been included, covering either custom fabrication or off-the-shelf selection, as well as the structural layout and component mounting strategy. Key mechanical and electrical engineering parameters such as torque, rotational speed (RPM), gear ratios, and power requirements had been addressed to demonstrate performance optimization.
## 1.1 Self-Driving Car Design
## 1.2 Chassis of Self-Driving Car
Our self-driving car uses a strong and lightweight chassis built with LEGO Technic parts. The main structure is based on the LEGO 32019 rim, which provides a solid base to attach motors, sensors, and other components. We use a differential gear system to help the car turn smoothly and maintain balance when moving. The tyres used are LEGO 86652, chosen for their good grip and stability on different surfaces. This chassis design is easy to modify and allows us to test and improve the car during development. It also keeps the weight evenly distributed, which helps the car move more accurately during autonomous tasks.
### 1.2.1 Self-Driving Car's Tyre
For our self-driving car, we selected the LEGO 86652 tyres due to their excellent grip and compatibility with our wheel and axle setup. These tyres offer reliable traction on various surfaces, which is essential for accurate movement and stability during autonomous navigation. Their size and tread pattern help maintain balance and reduce slipping, especially when the car is turning or adjusting its path. The tyres also support the differential gear system effectively, allowing smooth power distribution between the left and right wheels. Overall, the LEGO 86652 tyres contribute to better control, performance, and safety of the vehicle throughout its operation.
### 1.2.2 Differential Gear
Our self-driving car uses a differential gear system to improve its turning performance and overall movement control. The differential allows the left and right wheels to rotate at different speeds when the car is turning, which helps prevent wheel skidding and improves stability. This is especially important during autonomous navigation, where precise movement is required. By evenly distributing torque between the wheels, the differential gear also helps maintain balance and smooth transitions when changing direction. Using LEGO Technic components, the differential is integrated into the drivetrain in a compact and efficient layout, ensuring both functionality and ease of maintenance.
### 1.2.3 Selection of Motor and Its Engineering Principle
### 1.2.4 Connection of Motor the Chassis
## 1.3 Steering
Our self-driving car implements an Ackermann steering system, which is designed to mimic the natural turning geometry used in real-world vehicles. This system ensures that the inner and outer front wheels turn at different angles during a curve, allowing for smoother and more accurate cornering. By minimizing tyre slip and mechanical strain, Ackermann steering improves the car’s handling and reduces energy loss during turns. We built the steering mechanism using LEGO Technic components, carefully aligning the pivot points to approximate true Ackermann geometry. This setup is mechanically efficient and integrates well with our differential gear system, resulting in precise directional control and crucial for autonomous path following tasks.

**(i) Pixy 2 Camera**

In our self-driving car, the Pixy2 Camera is used exclusively for object and colour signature recognition, which plays a crucial role in the vehicle's ability to navigate the environment intelligently. We trained the Pixy2 to detect specific colour markers placed on objects such as pillars and parking boundaries. These colour signatures act as visual cues that allow the robot to identify obstacles and make appropriate navigation decisions. For example, the car uses the Pixy2 to recognize coloured pillars and determine whether to steer left or right to avoid collisions. Additionally, the camera helps the vehicle detect designated parking zones and execute precise movements when entering or exiting these areas.

The following figures shows a close-up view of the Pixy2 Camera:

The Pixy2 is mounted at the top of the chassis with a clear line of vision toward the forward surroundings. It is calibrated using PixyMon v2 software, where we fine-tuned the camera’s brightness, colour threshold, and exposure settings to ensure consistent object detection under different lighting conditions. By offloading the visual processing to the camera's onboard system, we reduce the processing burden on the main controller, allowing for quicker reactions and smoother movements.
This simple yet effective use of the Pixy2 enhances the robot's ability to navigate autonomously in dynamic settings, particularly during tasks that involve object avoidance and parking. It ensures that the car can respond accurately to visual input with minimal latency, which is essential for maintaining performance during the competition.

**(ii) Color Sensor**
TCS3472 RGB Color Sensor

Our self-driving car integrates the TCS3472 RGB Color Sensor to enhance its ability to detect and respond to specific colors in the competition environment. The TCS3472 is an advanced color recognition module that combines a red, green, and blue (RGB) sensing element with a clear photodiode, along with an IR blocking filter to improve color accuracy under different lighting conditions. It also features an integrated ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) that outputs digital values for each color channel,
